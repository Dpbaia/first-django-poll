# The {% static %} template tag is not available for use in static files which aren’t generated by Django, like your stylesheet. 
# You should always use relative paths to link your static files between each other, because then you can change STATIC_URL (used by the static template tag to generate its URLs) without having to modify a bunch of paths in your static files as well.
